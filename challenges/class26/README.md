# Challenge Summary
Complete a working, tested implementation of Insertion Sort, based on the pseudo code provided.

## Challenge Description
Follow the provided Psuedo Code and write a solution in JavaScript. 
<!-- InsertionSort(int[] arr)
  
    FOR i = 1 to arr.length
    
      int j <-- i - 1
      int temp <-- arr[i]
      
      WHILE j >= 0 AND temp < arr[j]
        arr[j + 1] <-- arr[j]
        j <-- j - 1
        
      arr[j + 1] <-- temp -->

## Approach & Efficiency
My approach to this problem was to understand what exactly the pseudo code was supposed to do, and what the output should be. After that, I went line by line translating the code to JavaScript. This was completely rather efficiently after understanding what the code was doing.
